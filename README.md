# CHEFREG

This is a web-based data management system created for out honours project. The system is the result of a co-design initiative with chef students, lecturers, admin staff and chefs from Infinity Culinary Training, a chef school in Cape Town. In this project, we created software prototypes of a data management tool, which was divided up into three parts:
1. Mobile application
2. Web-based data management tool with the following components:
    1. Data entry
    2. Data reporting
    3. Data management

This is the code for the web-based data management tool. Code to the mobile application can be found at https://github.com/sewagodimo/ChefSchoolAndroidApp.
