# CHEFREG

This is a web-based data management system created for my honours project. The system is the result of a co-design initiative with chef students, lecturers, admin staff and chefs from Infinity Culinary Training, a chef school in Cape Town. In this project, we created software prototypes of a data management tool, which was divided up into three parts:
1. Mobile application
2. Data management tool
3. Data entry and data reporting tool

This is the code for the Data entry and data reporting tool. Code to the mobile application can be found at https://github.com/sewagodimo/ChefSchoolAndroidApp and the data management tool at https://github.com/AmyLBrodie/HonoursProject.

## Features
 1. Store student information
 2. View overall statistics
 3. Filter statistics by year(s) of admission or class number(s)
